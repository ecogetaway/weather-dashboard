- Browser accessibility tools

**Steps**:
1. **Keyboard Navigation**:
   - Tab through all interactive elements
   - Use Enter/Space to activate buttons
   - Navigate search suggestions with arrow keys
   
2. **Screen Reader**:
   - Enable screen reader
   - Navigate through the app
   - Verify all content is announced properly
   
3. **Visual**:
   - Test with high contrast mode
   - Verify color contrast ratios
   - Test with 200% zoom level

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ All interactive elements are keyboard accessible
- ✅ Focus indicators are clearly visible
- ✅ Screen reader announces all content meaningfully
- ✅ No information is conveyed by color alone
- ✅ Text remains readable at high zoom levels

---

### 5. **Performance Testing**
**Objective**: Verify app loads quickly and performs well

**Tools**:
- Chrome DevTools Lighthouse
- Network throttling (3G simulation)
- Performance monitor (built into app)

**Steps**:
1. Open Chrome DevTools
2. Run Lighthouse audit
3. Throttle network to "Slow 3G"
4. Measure initial page load time
5. Test weather data loading performance
6. Check bundle size and caching

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Lighthouse Performance score > 90
- ✅ First Contentful Paint < 2 seconds
- ✅ Largest Contentful Paint < 2.5 seconds
- ✅ Cumulative Layout Shift < 0.1
- ✅ App loads within 3 seconds on 3G

### 6. **Error Handling Test**
**Objective**: Verify graceful error handling

**Steps**:
1. **Network Errors**:
   - Disconnect internet during weather fetch
   - Enter invalid city name
   - Test with very slow connection
   
2. **API Errors**:
   - Use invalid API key (if possible)
   - Test rate limiting scenarios
   
3. **User Errors**:
   - Leave search field empty and submit
   - Enter special characters in search
   - Test very long city names

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Clear error messages appear
- ✅ Retry buttons are provided where appropriate
- ✅ App doesn't crash or become unusable
- ✅ User can recover from error states
- ✅ Toast notifications inform user of issues

### 7. **Cross-Browser Testing**
**Objective**: Ensure compatibility across browsers

**Test Browsers**:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Mobile Safari (iOS)
- Chrome Mobile (Android)

**Steps**:
1. Open app in each browser
2. Test core functionality
3. Verify visual consistency
4. Test offline features
5. Check performance

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ App functions identically across browsers
- ✅ Visual design remains consistent
- ✅ No browser-specific errors occur
- ✅ Performance remains acceptable
